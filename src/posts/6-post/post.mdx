### Skipping Ahead to Visual Accessbility Modes

Instead of the usual Light & Dark mode options I thought it'd be fun to create a high-contrast Dark Mode & a Large Text Mode.

It's pretty straight forward to use [styled-components ThemeProvider](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/04/dark-mode-react-apps-styled-components/) to change modes across your website but it becomes a little hairy when using Gatsby.

I decided to use the useContext hook to pass the state of the theme through my website. I set up all the state and functions in a separate AppProvider/AppContext file called context.js located in the components folder.

I created a themes folder that holds my global-style, my style helper functions and a file called Themes.js to hold my various themes.

In my root wrapper file I passed in my AppProvider and my Global Styles.

Then, I used the useContext hook to pull in the state to toggle my menu button into my Navbar component and the toggle the theme button into my layout component.

My ThemeProvider went into my context.js file where all my logic sits.
