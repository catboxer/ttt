I had heard about JAMstack from a support person at Nexcess where I host my E-Commerce site. Then I came across this video and this guy's clear explanation had me understanding the appeal of building a Jamstack. In this course he uses Eleventy as his static site generator and Netlifly to deploy.

Using the JAMstack I could hook up various API's, create static sites that loaded quickly and not have to deal with a server if I didn't want to. Damn. I climbed right on board and have been a headless CMS fan since then. I've dealt with speed issues on my e-commerce site since I launched it and this looked like an appealing solution.
