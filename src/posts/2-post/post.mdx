I had heard about JAMstack from a support person at Nexcess where I
host my E-Commerce site. Then I came across this video and easy to understand explanation
had me understanding the appeal of building a Jamstack. In this course he uses Eleventy
as his static site generator and Netlifly to deploy.

Using the JAMstack I could hook up various API's, create static sites that loaded quickly and not have to deal with a server if I didn't want to. I've dealt with speed issues on my e-commerce site since I launched it and this looked like an appealing solution. It would prove to be a long journey.
