### GraphQL Classes

I've been spending a bit of time trying to pick up graphQL. I ended up taking a [Gatsby class on Udemy by John Smigla](https://www.udemy.com/share/101ZimAkEbcFZTTQ==/) whom I like quite a bit because he's so project oriented. I knew I needed some sort of personal website and his Gatsby class came with the opportunity to learn markup and graphQL via a Blog Project.

I signed up for a couple of other GraphQL courses but haven't had the time to do through them quite yet. I will update here if I find a good one. I was also going to check out the [graphQL tutorial](https://graphql.org/learn/).

I took John's general layout/components and pulled in a Twitter list, added an SVG animation, redid the layout to make it more accessible and added in a sidebar with links and twitter posts that matched with the category page.

This project did give me some more time with graphql queries but not so much with mutations. I didn't touch the backside schemas or apollo.

### Destructuring

I also learned nested destructuring as the twitter API contained several layers of objects holding an array nesting another object. It took me a bit of time and reading this [fantastic article on destructuring. ](https://codeburst.io/es6-destructuring-the-complete-guide-7f842d08b98f) to be able to access "url".

```jsx
  "data": {
  "coderlist": {
      "nodes": [ {
        "full_text": "text",
        "id": "id",
        "user": {
            "name": "MF DOOM",
            "profile_image_url_https": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images.jpg", "screen_name": "MF_DOOM"
            },
      "entities": {
            "urls": [ {
                "url": "https://Fazers"
                } ]
      }
  }
```
