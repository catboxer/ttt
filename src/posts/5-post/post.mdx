### It started with the FOUC

When my blog finally went live on Netlify I saw that unwelcome flash of unstyled content on load. Locally it had looked great. What had happened? I started looking around for a solution and learned a lot along the way.

I am using styled components so I began with making sure all the [proper plugins installed](https://dev.to/mikaelia/removing-fouc-in-a-gatsby-app-28mg).

I considered adding or removing a body class via Helmet so that the styles and js would load before showing the content.

Then I saw this [FOUC solution using the gatsby-browser and server files](https://curtistimson.co.uk/post/gatsbyjs/add-body-class-gatsbyjs-fouc/).

If you want to try this solution here's the updated code for gatsby-ssr.js:

```jsx
export const onRenderBody = ({ setBodyAttributes }) => {
  setBodyAttributes({
    className: "no-js",
  })
}
```

and for gatsby-brower.js

```jsx
export const onClientEntry = () => {
  window.addEventListener("load", () => {
    document.body.className = document.body.className.replace(/\bno-js\b/, "")
  })
}
```

It appeared to add a class to my body and remove it upon load but it didn't solve my unstyled logo and fonts issue. Plus, it caused a long lag before anything else loaded. So, I tried a different solution.

#### SVG

For my svg Logo I discovered:
a. that you can't have responsive SVGs or it will load with a viewport size of 100% causing a big flash.
b. inline svg mitigates the fouc.

#### Fonts

I then tried installing [typography.js](https://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/) but quickly realized it would take a bit of work as I'd already set up my styled-components. I'd use it if I were just starting up a project but after all my time investment I installed the [gatsby-plugin-webfonts](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-webfonts/) and this seemed to help a preload the fonts but fonts still slowed down the speed of my site so I decided to self host.

I [downloaded this my Google fonts & font faces using this great tool](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts/open-sans?subsets=latin) and added them into my static folder.

It is much better but I'm still not completely satisfied.

### Optimization

I went down a rabbit hole for a couple of days trying to raise my [page speed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/). I spent hours trying to optimize into the green. My site passed everything except for the Javascript and I ultimately gave up, recognizing that I was going to have to [learn a lot more about Babel and the Gatsby webpack config](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/webpack-libs-optimizations) before I was going to be able to 'deliver smaller JS payloads', remove unused JS and avoid serving legacy JS to modern browers with a module check.

I ultimately ended up going with custom fonts and using the [Omni Font Loader plug in](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-omni-font-loader/) as it gave the most options without going over my head.
